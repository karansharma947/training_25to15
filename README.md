#Day 1 of learning something new 
# Day 1 - 25th June 2025

##  What I Learned Today

###  Linux vs Windows

Today, I learned about *Linux* and how it is different from *Windows*:

- Linux is *open-source*, which means anyone can see its code and change it.
- Windows is *closed-source*, and only Microsoft controls it.
- Linux is mostly used by developers and in servers.
- Windows is used more in personal computers and offices.
- Linux has many versions like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- Windows has only a few versions like Windows 10, 11.

###  Product vs Service vs Startup

I also understood the difference between:

- *Product*: A thing you can use or buy. Example: a mobile app or software.
- *Service*: Work done for someone. Example: food delivery, repair service.
- *Startup*: A new company with an idea to solve a problem. It can give product or service.

###  Installing VirtualBox and Ubuntu

We also learned how to *install VirtualBox*, which is a tool to run another operating system inside our computer.

Steps I followed:

1. Downloaded and installed *VirtualBox*.
2. Downloaded the *Ubuntu ISO file* (a Linux OS).
3. Created a new machine in VirtualBox.

# Day 2 of learning something new

## Booting and its types:
Booting is the process of starting up or restarting a computer, which involves initializing hardware, loading the operating system, and preparing the computer for use.
### Types of Booting:
- **Cold boot/ Hard boot:**
  This refers to starting the computer from a completely powered-off state.
- **Warm boot/ Soft boot:**
  This is when the operating system alone is restarted wihtout turning it off.

  ## Introduction to Linux Shell and basic commands:
### Kernel:
- The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
- Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).

### Shell:
- Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services.
- Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

Shell is divided into two categories-
1. Command Line Shell:

**Types of shell:**
- BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
- CSH (C SHell)
- KSH (Korn SHell)

 ### File system structure:
| NAME | DESCRIPTION                                                                   |

| `/home`   | Contains personal directories of user. |
| `/lib`    | Contains system libraries and critical file.|
| `/bin`    | Contains user executable files.|
| `/boot`   | Contains all the files that are required for booting.|
| `/dev`    | Contains hardware and development files.|
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media.|
| `/mnt`    | Temporarily mounted filesystems.|
| `/opt`    | Contains optional files. |

## Commands:
