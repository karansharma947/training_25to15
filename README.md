#Day 1 of learning something new 
# Day 1 - 25th June 2025

##  What I Learned Today

###  Linux vs Windows

Today, I learned about *Linux* and how it is different from *Windows*:

- Linux is *open-source*, which means anyone can see its code and change it.
- Windows is *closed-source*, and only Microsoft controls it.
- Linux is mostly used by developers and in servers.
- Windows is used more in personal computers and offices.
- Linux has many versions like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- Windows has only a few versions like Windows 10, 11.

###  Product vs Service vs Startup

I also understood the difference between:

- *Product*: A thing you can use or buy. Example: a mobile app or software.
- *Service*: Work done for someone. Example: food delivery, repair service.
- *Startup*: A new company with an idea to solve a problem. It can give product or service.

###  Installing VirtualBox and Ubuntu

We also learned how to *install VirtualBox*, which is a tool to run another operating system inside our computer.

Steps I followed:

1. Downloaded and installed *VirtualBox*.
2. Downloaded the *Ubuntu ISO file* (a Linux OS).
3. Created a new machine in VirtualBox.
