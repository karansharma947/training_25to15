# Day 1 - 25th June 2025

##  What I Learned Today

###  Linux vs Windows

Today, I learned about *Linux* and how it is different from *Windows*:

- Linux is *open-source*, which means anyone can see its code and change it.
- Windows is *closed-source*, and only Microsoft controls it.
- Linux is mostly used by developers and in servers.
- Windows is used more in personal computers and offices.
- Linux has many versions like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- Windows has only a few versions like Windows 10, 11.

###  Product vs Service vs Startup

I also understood the difference between:

- *Product*: A thing you can use or buy. Example: a mobile app or software.
- *Service*: Work done for someone. Example: food delivery, repair service.
- *Startup*: A new company with an idea to solve a problem. It can give product or service.

###  Installing VirtualBox and Ubuntu

We also learned how to *install VirtualBox*, which is a tool to run another operating system inside our computer.

Steps I followed:

1. Downloaded and installed *VirtualBox*.
2. Downloaded the *Ubuntu ISO file* (a Linux OS).
3. Created a new machine in VirtualBox.

# Day 2 of learning something new

## Booting and its types:
Booting is the process of starting up or restarting a computer, which involves initializing hardware, loading the operating system, and preparing the computer for use.
### Types of Booting:
- **Cold boot/ Hard boot:**
  This refers to starting the computer from a completely powered-off state.
- **Warm boot/ Soft boot:**
  This is when the operating system alone is restarted wihtout turning it off.

  ## Introduction to Linux Shell and basic commands:
### Kernel:
- The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
- Think of it as as Chef working in a hotel. You as a coustmer can't see the chef working but get your order (output).

### Shell:
- Shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services.
- Using the same scenario, think of shell as a waiter, who takes your order (input) and gives it to the chef (Kernel).

Shell is divided into two categories-
1. Command Line Shell:

2. Graphical shell:

**Types of shell:**
- BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
- CSH (C SHell)
- KSH (Korn SHell)

 ### File system structure:
| NAME | DESCRIPTION                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | The slash / character denotes the root of the filesystem tree. exp: Trunk of a tree.|
| `/home`   | Contains personal directories of user. |
| `/lib`    | Contains system libraries and critical file.|
| `/bin`    | Contains user executable files.|
| `/boot`   | Contains all the files that are required for booting.|
| `/dev`    | Contains hardware and development files.|
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media.|
| `/mnt`    | Temporarily mounted filesystems.|
| `/opt`    | Contains optional files. |

## Commands:
- `date`: Returns current date.
- `whoami`: Returns the current domain and user name.
- `ls` (list): Returns content of a specified Directory
- `cd`: Changes directory.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `touch`: Creates empty file.
- `cat`: Creates file with content.
- `whereis`: Finds the location of specified file.
- `mv`: To move or rename a file.
- `cp`: To copy content of a file to the other
- `whatis`: Gives short description of a command.

# Day 3 of learning something new:
## Permissions & Shell programming:
### File and directory permissions:
`chmod` (Change mode): It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

Some different chmod permission notations are:<br>
 `chmod +x test.sh`:  Gives permission to run the script.<br>
 `chmod 444 test.sh`: Changes file to read-only
 `chmod 644 test.sh`: Changes file such that only owner can edit it. For others it remain read-only.

### Redirection:
 It allows user to redirect input and output functionalities to the files or folders. 

**Types of Redirection:**
1. Overwrite Redirection (For stdout):<br>
Redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists already contain script, it will be overwritten.<br>
">" standard output<br>


2. Append Redirection (For stdout): 
Append the output to the file without compromising the existing data of the file.

3. Overwrite Redirection (For stdin):<br> 
Redirects the standard input of a command to a file.<br>
"<" standard input

### Pipe '|':
The pipe is used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command.

*Pipe can be used for filteration.* <br>
Multiple pipes can be used such as:

*to find number of file/directory with 't'* <br>
